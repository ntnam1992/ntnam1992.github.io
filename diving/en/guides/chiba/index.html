                        <p>Chiba Prefecturein the southeast of the Kanto Region, is famous as the home of Narita
                            Airport, the largest international airport in Japan. Much of Chiba is made up of the Boso
                            Peninsula, sticking out into the Pacific Ocean, making it an ideal location for marine
                            activities such as fishing, surfing, and of course, scuba diving. Easily accessible from
                            Tokyo and boasting many fun dive sites, Chiba is an ideal diving destination.</p>
                        <p>Most of Chiba’s dive sites are located on the southern coast of the peninsula, where the
                            Kuroshio Current arrivesbringing warm, clear, and nutrient-rich water from the south. Tokyo
                            Bay and its abundant marine life lie on the west side of the peninsula, and on the east side
                            the Kuroshio Current meets the Oyashio Current, creating a unique environment.</p>
